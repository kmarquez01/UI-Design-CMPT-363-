# UI-Design-CMPT-363-

  In this class, we were tasked to create an improved interface of the calendar API given in our canvas website SFU. We decided to use the app known as "Figma" to showcase our changes. 
  
  A few of the changes include the following:
  
  Functional requirements: 
  - The Day box should have a button with “...” which will expand a day and provide a more detailed view for that day (figure 6). 
  - Calendar should allow the user to cross off all events manually (figure 7).
  - Users should be able to import other calendars into their canvas calendar with the iCal feature (figure 8).

  Non-functional requirements:
  - Each day that has multiple events should show only the first two in the calendar with a “...” indicator to avoid unnecessary scrolling due to extra long rows. 
  - Groups for a class should appear below the class they pertain to and be   indented or linked in a similar fashion to how a directory tree would appear. 
  - Shows a toast message when users cross off an event
